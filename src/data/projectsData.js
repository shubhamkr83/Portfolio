        overview: "An enterprise-grade REST API automation framework featuring dual API support for BOMB (Admin/Seller operations at bizup.app) and Buyer App (Navo Fashion consumer API at api.navofashion.in). This production-ready framework converts a complete Postman collection into a robust RestAssured + TestNG solution with 56 test files, 40+ endpoints, comprehensive CI/CD integration, and automated reporting. Features include JWT authentication, AI-powered video title generation, performance validation (800ms threshold for Buyer App), and complete workflow pipeline testing with 95%+ success rate.",

        structure: "Clean architecture with dual API support (BOMB and Buyer App) sharing a unified framework. Base layer includes TestNG BaseTest, ConfigManager with Owner properties, and RestClient wrapper. Constants layer manages BombEndpoints and BuyerAppEndpoints. Request/Response POJOs handle complex nested structures (LoginResponse, CatalogResponse, FeedFilterResponse). CI/CD pipeline integrates Jenkins with Python scripts for TestNG result parsing, email/chat notifications, and S3 uploads with timestamped folders. Test execution uses priority-based dependencies and VariableManager for cross-test data sharing.",
